adding packages:
- uv add numpy

This adds the package to the pyproject.toml

running a file from terminal:
- uv run main.py

if someone else tries to run the project:
- uv sync

removing a package:
- uv remove numpy

someone sends then back the project I have to do uv sync again
and uv automatically detect that the other person has uv removed
something and will handle the whole thing for me as well
